# bitclock
a digital clock for your terminal that automatically resizes itself, with customizable colors!

# usage:
```
$ gem install bitclock
```

# command-line execution
```
$ bitclock
```
you can optionally give ANSI color names as arguments for hours, minutes and seconds:
```
$ bitclock red green blue
```

thanks for visiting this repo, it's my first gem and actually just a test to build more!
